            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Nambi Narayanan (born 12 December 1941)[4] is an Indian aerospace scientist who worked for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). As a senior official at the ISRO, he was briefly in charge of the cryogenics division.[5] He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award, in March 2019.[6]

                In 1994, he was arrested on trumped up charges of espionage.[7] The charges against him were found to be baseless by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April 1996.[8] As a result, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all charges against him and prohibited the Government of Kerala from continuing its investigation on technical grounds.[9] In 2018, a Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, awarded Narayanan a compensation of ₹50 lakh (equivalent to ₹67 lakh or US$83,000 in 2023). Additionally, the Government of Kerala then awarded him further compensation to the tune of ₹1.3 crore (equivalent to ₹1.7 crore or US$220,000 in 2023) in 2019.[10][11] The film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, based on his life, starring and directed by R. Madhavan, was released in July 2022.</p>
